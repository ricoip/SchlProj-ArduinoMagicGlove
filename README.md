# Robot Arm powered by an Arduino
âš  The code is released as-is, and will only work on my specific configuration.  
**No support will be provided whatsoever.** Don't email me about this.

The Arduino code controls the movement of servos by mapping the input capacitance between two sheets of graphite (which were placed within a glove).

## Origins
This project is the final product from the extra-curricular activity "Little Inventor" I attended in secondary school (academic year 2020-2021).

The aim is to create a robot arm that can move, which is controlled by how far you move your fingers.

Well, at the final stage, the arm is sort of functional, but still suffers from random jitters.  
(To this day, I still have no idea why capacitance is measured/calculated and not resistance, but I guess we'll never know.)
